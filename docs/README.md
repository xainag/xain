# XAIN Federated Learning

XAIN provides privacy-preserving technology dedicated to keep the data
used for the training of AI projects private. Our privacy engine for
machine learning is compliant with data privacy regulations such as
GDPR and CCPA. It offers a simple and scalable multi-party computation
based on federated learning that reflects technical and regulatory
needs of commercial AI projects.
