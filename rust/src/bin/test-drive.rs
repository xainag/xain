/// Test-drive script of a (completely local) single-round federated learning

/// [`Service`] and 10 [`Client`]s on the tokio event loop. This serves as a
/// simple example of getting started with the project, and may later be the
/// basis for more automated tests.
///
/// important NOTE since we only test a few clients and by default, the
/// selection ratios in the Coordinator are relatively small, it is very
/// possible no (or too few) participants will be selected here! It's currently
/// not possible to configure or force the selection, hence as a TEMP
/// workaround, these should be adjusted in coordinator.rs before running this
/// test e.g. 0.2_f64 for sum and 0.4_f64 for update.
