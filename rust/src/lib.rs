//! # XayNet: federated learning made private, performant, and ubiquitous
//!
//! ###### tags: Xayn, Federated Learning, Privacy
//!
//! Want a framework that supports federated learning on the edge, in desktop browsers, integrates
//! well with mobile apps, is performant, and preserves privacy? Welcome to XayNet, written entirely
//! in Rust!
//!
//! ## Making federated learning easy for developers
//! Frameworks for machine learning - including those expressly for federated learning - exist
//! already. These frameworks typically require the use of specific machine learning technology -
//! for example TensorFlow - or facilitate federated learning of cross-silo use cases - for example
//! in collaborative learning across a limited number of hospitals.
//!
//! We want to give developers more freedom of choice and abilities in the creation of federated
//! learning software. By doing this, we hope to also increase the pace and scope of adoption of
//! federated learning in practice.
//!
//! Concretely, we provide developers with:
//! - **My AI tools:** The flexibility to use the machine-learning frameworks and tools of their
//!   choice.
//! - **My app dev tools:** The ability to integrate federated learning into apps written in Dart,
//!   Python or other languages of choice, as well as frameworks like Flutter.
//! - **"Federated learning" everywhere:** The ability to run federated learning everywhere - be it
//!   desktop browsers, smartphones or micro-controllers.
//! - **"Federated learning" inside:** A simple integration means of making an AI application ready
//!   for federated learning.
//! - **Privacy by design:** A communication protocol for federated learning that scales, is secure,
//!   and preserves the privacy of participating devices.
//!
//! ## The case for writing this framework in Rust
//! Rust has definite potential as a host language for machine learning itself. But, above, we
//! already insisted on giving developers freedom of choice here. Hence, we selected Rust for other
//! reasons.
//!
//! Our framework for federated learning is not a framework for machine learning as such. Rather, it
//! supports the *federation* of machine learning that takes place on possibly heterogeneous devices
//! and where use cases involve *many* such devices.
//!
//! The programming language in which this framework is written should therefore give us strong
//! support for the following:
//! - **Compiles and runs "everywhere":** The language should *not* require its own runtime and code
//!   should compile on a wide range of devices.
//! - **Memory and Concurrency Safety:** Code that compiles should be both memory safe and free of
//!   data races.
//! - **Secure communication:** State of the art cryptography should be available in vetted
//!   implementations.
//! - **Asynchronous communication:** Abstractions for asynchronous communication should exist that
//!   make federated learning scale.
//! - **Fast and functional:** The language should offer functional abstractions but also compile
//!   code into fast executables.
//!
//! Rust is one of the very few choices of modern programming languages that meet these
//! requirements:
//! - Its concepts of *Ownership* and *Borrowing* make it both memory and thread-safe (hence
//!   avoiding potential concurrency issues).
//! - It has a strong and static type discipline and traits, which describe shareable functionality
//!   of a type.
//! - It has rich functional abstractions, for example the `tower-service` based on the foundational
//!   trait `Service`.
//! - Its idiomatic code compares favorably to idiomatic C in performance.
//! - It is widely deployable and doesn't necessarily depend on a runtime, unlike languages such as
//!   Java and their need for a virtual machine to run its code. Foreign Function Interfaces support
//!   calls from other languages/frameworks, including Dart, Python and Flutter.
//! - And it compiles into LLVM, and so it can draw from the abundant tool suites for LLVM.
//!
//! ## We love XayNet and would like to hear about your use of it
//! We feel blessed to have such a strong Engineering team that includes several senior Rust
//! developers and folks who were eager to become experienced Rust programmers themselves! All of us
//! are excited to share the fruits of this labor with you.
//!
//! So without further ado, here is the release of XayNet, our federated learning framework written
//! entirely in Rust. We hope you will like and use this framework. And we will be grateful for any
//! feedback, contributions or news on your usage of XayNet in your own projects.
