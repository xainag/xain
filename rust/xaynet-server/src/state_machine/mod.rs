//!
//! The [`StateMachine`] is responsible for executing the individual tasks of the PET protocol.
//! The main tasks include: building the sum and seed dictionaries, aggregating the masked
//! models, determining the applicable mask and unmasking the global masked model.
//!
//! Furthermore, the [`StateMachine`] publishes protocol events and handles protocol errors.
//!
//! The [`StateMachine`] as well as the PET settings can be configured in the config file.
//! See [here][settings] for more details.
//!
//! # Phase states
//!
//! **Idle**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Idle`], increments the `round id` by `1`, invalidates the
//! [`SumDict`], [`SeedDict`], `scalar` and `mask length`, updates the [`EncryptKeyPair`],
//! `thresholds` as well as the `seed` and publishes the [`EncryptKeyPair`] and the
//! [`RoundParameters`].
//!
//! **Sum**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Sum`], builds and publishes the [`SumDict`], ensures that enough sum
//! messages have been submitted and initializes the [`SeedDict`].
//!
//! **Update**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Update`], builds and publishes the [`SeedDict`], ensures that enough
//! update messages have been submitted and aggregates the masked model.
//!
//! **Sum2**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Sum2`], builds the mask dictionary, ensures that enough sum2
//! messages have been submitted and determines the applicable mask for unmasking the global
//! masked model.
//!
//! **Unmask**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Unmask`], unmasks the global masked model and publishes the global
//! model.
//!
//! **Error**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Error`] and handles [`PhaseStateError`]s that can occur during the
//! execution of the [`StateMachine`]. In most cases, the error is handled by restarting the round.
//! However, if a [`PhaseStateError::RequestChannel`] occurs, the [`StateMachine`] will shut down.
//!
//! **Shutdown**
//!
//! Publishes [`PhaseName::Shutdown`] and shuts down the [`StateMachine`]. During the shutdown,
//! the [`StateMachine`] performs a clean shutdown of the [Request][requests_idx] channel by
//! closing it and consuming all remaining messages.
//!
//! # Requests
//!
//! By initiating a new [`StateMachine`] via [`StateMachineInitializer::init()`], a new
//! [StateMachineRequest][requests_idx] channel is created, the function of which is to send
//! [`StateMachineRequest`]s to the [`StateMachine`]. The sender half of that channel
//! ([`RequestSender`]) is returned back to the caller of
//! [`StateMachineInitializer::init()`], whereas the receiver half ([`RequestReceiver`])
//! is used by the [`StateMachine`].
//!
//! See [here][requests] for more details.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! During the execution of the PET protocol, the [`StateMachine`] will publish various events
//! (see Phase states). Everyone who is interested in the events can subscribe to the respective
//! events via the [`EventSubscriber`]. An [`EventSubscriber`] is automatically created when a new
//! [`StateMachine`] is created through [`StateMachineInitializer::init()`].
//!
//! See [here][events] for more details.
