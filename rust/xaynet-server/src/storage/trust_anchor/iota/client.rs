//! # IOTA trust anchor integration
//!
//! To fight against AI misuse the coordinator signs the hash of the decrypted aggregated global
//! model and publishes it to the IOTA Tangle. The hash is calculated from the `bincode` encoded
//! model. It is the same encoding that is sent to the user via the API.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // global_model: Model
//! let global_model_hash = hex::encode(bincode::serialize(&global_model).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! IOTA trust anchor integration is based on IOTA
//! [Streams](https://docs.iota.org/docs/channels/1.3/overview).
//!
//! ### General workflow
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // create a channel by sending an announcement message.
//! let announcement_msg_id = author.send_announce().unwrap();
//!
//! // send first message / link it to the announcement message
//! let (msg_id, seq) = author.send_signed_packet(&announcement_msg_id, &public_payload, &Bytes::new());
//!
//! // send second message / link it to the first message
//! // here we can use `gen_next_msg_ids` to get the current msg ID
//! let current_msg_id = author.gen_next_msg_ids(false).last().unwrap().1.link;
//! let _ = author.send_signed_packet(&current_msg_id, &public_payload, &Bytes::new());
//!
//! // now we only repeat the previous step to send the next message
//! ```
//!
//! Currently there is no way to check if the announcement message has already been sent.
//! It is not possible to just create the announcement message ID which we could use
//! to check if the message exists in the tangle. We only have the `send_announce` method
//! to choose from. However, this method always creates and sends an announcement message
//! in one step. That means that in the end there could be multiple announcement messages with
//! the same id. Obviously that's not ok but I don't how we could fix it on our side.
//!
//! ### Side note
//!
//! There is also the method `gen_next_msg_ids` which returns the current and the next message ID.
//! Interestingly, this does not work until we send the first signed message which was linked
//! to the announcement message. (see general workflow)
//!
//! To reduce the risk of having multiple messages with the same id we make some assumptions:
//!
//! **Sequence Number**
//!
//! Since `gen_next_msg_ids` returns the current message ID + the sequence number we can
//! check whether at least one message has already been sent.
//!
//! To be more precise:
//! If the sequence number is greater than one, we know that at least one signed message
//! has already been sent. If the sequence number is one, we know that no signed message has
//! been sent yet, however, we do not know whether the announcement message has already
//! been sent or not.
//!
//! **`AuthorStore` returns state**
//!
//! If the `AuthorStore` returns some state we know that we have already sent the
//! announcement message because we always save the state after sending the
//! announcement message.
//! However, we can never be sure that the status returned by the `AuthorStore` is the latest state,
//! as the coordinator could have crashed between the sending and saving methods.
//!
//! ### Caveat
//!
//! With these assumptions we can reduce the risk of having multiple messages with the same ID,
//! but we cannot prevent it!
