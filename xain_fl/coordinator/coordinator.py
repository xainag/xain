class Coordinator:  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    """Class implementing the main Coordinator logic. It is implemented as a
    state machine that reacts to received messages.

    The states of the Coordinator are:

        - ``STANDBY``: The coordinator is in standby mode, typically
          when waiting for participants to connect. In this mode the
          only messages that the coordinator can receive are
          :class:`~.coordinator_pb2.RendezvousRequest` and
          :class:`~.coordinator_pb2.HeartbeatRequest`.

        - ``ROUND``: A round is currently in progress. During a round
          the important messages the coordinator can receive are
          :class:`~.coordinator_pb2.StartTrainingRoundRequest` and
          :class:`~.coordinator_pb2.EndTrainingRoundRequest`.  Since
          participants may or may not be selected for rounds, they can be
          advertised accordingly with ROUND or STANDBY respectively.
          Round numbers start from 0.

        - ``FINISHED``: The training session has ended and
          participants should disconnect from the coordinator.

    States are exchanged during heartbeats so that both coordinators
    and participants can react to each others state change.

    The flow of the Coordinator:

        1. The coordinator is started and waits for enough participants to join. `STANDBY`.
        2. Once enough participants are connected the coordinator starts the rounds. `ROUND`.
        3. Repeat step 2. for the given number of rounds
        4. The training session is over and the coordinator is ready to shutdown. `FINISHED`.

    Note:

        :class:`~.coordinator_pb2.RendezvousRequest` is always allowed
        regardless of which state the coordinator is on.

    Args:

        num_rounds: The number of rounds of the training session.

        minimum_participants_in_round: The minimum number of
            participants that participate in a round.

        fraction_of_participants: The fraction of total connected
            participants to be selected in a single round. Defaults to
            1.0, meaning that all connected participants will be
            selected. It must be in the (0.0, 1.0] interval.

        weights: The weights of the global model.

        epochs: Number of training iterations local to Participant.

        epochs_base: Global number of epochs as of last round.

        aggregator: The type of aggregation to perform at the end of
            each round. Defaults to :class:`~.WeightedAverageAggregator`.

        controller: Controls how the Participants are selected at the
            start of each round. Defaults to :class:`~.RandomController`.
